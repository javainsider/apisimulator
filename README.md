# API Simulator
Now a days it's very difficult to find free API's to test before your developers genertae the API for QA to start API automation test. the idea behind this project is to provide API simulator which will generate Mock API's based on your own specification. 
- Simple user registration
- API Screen Name (PROJECT NAME)
- API Definition (Template)
- API Test data feed ( Template Data)
- Delay response setting for API load testing
- More coming on its way....
